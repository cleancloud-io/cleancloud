# CleanCloud

**Safe, conservative cloud hygiene scanning for modern infrastructure teams.**

CleanCloud helps SRE and DevOps teams identify orphaned, untagged, and potentially inactive cloud resources—without the risk of automated cleanup or aggressive cost optimization heuristics.

## Why CleanCloud?

Modern cloud environments constantly create and destroy storage and logs. Over time, orphaned resources accumulate — no owner, no signal, and too risky to delete blindly.

Most cloud hygiene tools fall into two categories:

1. **Auto-delete everything** — Too dangerous for production
2. **Flag everything** — Too noisy to be useful

**CleanCloud is different:**

- ✅ **Read-only by design** — Never modifies, deletes, or tags resources
- ✅ **Conservative signals** — Multiple indicators, age-based confidence thresholds
- ✅ **IaC-aware** — Designed for elastic, automated infrastructure
- ✅ **Trust-first** — Review-only recommendations, never destructive actions
- ✅ **CI/CD friendly** — Exit codes, JSON/CSV output, confidence-based policies

**CleanCloud is not:**
- ❌ A cost optimization tool
- ❌ An automated cleanup service
- ❌ A FinOps dashboard

It’s a **hygiene layer** built for teams who value safety over automation.

## What CleanCloud Detects

### AWS Rules (4 currently)
- **Unattached EBS volumes** - Volumes not attached to any EC2 instance
- **Old EBS snapshots** - Snapshots older than 90 days (configurable)
- **Inactive CloudWatch log groups** - Log groups with infinite retention
- **Untagged resources** - EBS volumes, S3 buckets, log groups without tags

### Azure Rules (4 currently)
- **Unattached managed disks** - Disks not attached to any VM (7+ days old)
- **Old snapshots** - Snapshots older than 30 days
- **Untagged resources** - Managed disks and snapshots without tags
- **Unused public IPs** - Public IP addresses not attached to any resource

See [`docs/rules.md`](docs/rules.md) for detailed rule behavior and confidence thresholds.

## CI/CD Integration

CleanCloud is designed for CI/CD pipelines with predictable exit codes and policy enforcement.

#### Recommended: GitHub Actions with AWS OIDC (No Secrets)

CleanCloud supports AWS IAM Roles assumed via GitHub Actions OpenID Connect (OIDC).
This is the recommended approach for CI/CD usage.

**Benefits:**

* No long-lived AWS credentials
* No secrets stored in GitHub
* Short-lived, auditable credentials
* Read-only by design

**GitHub Actions Example (AWS)**

```yaml
permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  cleancloud:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure AWS credentials (OIDC)
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/CleanCloudCIReadOnly
          aws-region: us-east-1

      - name: Run CleanCloud hygiene scan
        run: |
          pip install cleancloud
          cleancloud scan \
            --provider aws \
            --output json \
            --output-file scan.json \
            --fail-on-confidence HIGH

      - name: Upload results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: cleancloud-results
          path: scan.json

```

### Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Scan completed successfully, no blocking findings |
| `1` | Configuration or unexpected error |
| `2` | Policy violation (findings detected with `--fail-on-findings` or `--fail-on-confidence`) |
| `3` | Missing permissions or invalid credentials |

### Policy Enforcement

```bash
# Fail only on HIGH confidence findings (recommended)
cleancloud scan --fail-on-confidence HIGH

# Fail on MEDIUM or higher confidence
cleancloud scan --fail-on-confidence MEDIUM

# Fail on any findings (strict mode, not recommended)
cleancloud scan --fail-on-findings
```

See [`docs/ci.md`](docs/ci.md) for complete CI/CD integration examples.

## Configuration

### AWS

CleanCloud supports three AWS authentication methods:

1. GitHub Actions OIDC (recommended for CI/CD)
2. AWS CLI profiles (local development)
3. Environment variables

**Local Development (AWS Profile)**

```bash
# Using AWS profile
aws configure --profile cleancloud
cleancloud scan --provider aws --profile cleancloud
```

**Environment Variables**
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

cleancloud scan --provider aws
```


**AWS IAM Policy (Minimum Read-Only Permissions)**

Attach the following identity-based policy to the IAM role or user used by CleanCloud
(including GitHub Actions OIDC roles):

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "EC2ReadOnly",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeVolumes",
                "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                "ec2:DescribeAvailabilityZones",
                "ec2:DescribeTags"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "CloudWatchLogsReadOnly",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:DescribeLogGroups",
                "logs:DescribeLogStreams",
                "logs:GetLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "S3ReadOnly",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetBucketTagging",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "STSIdentity",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sts:GetCallerIdentity",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Characteristics:**

* No Delete*, Create*, or Tag* permissions
* Safe for production accounts
* Compatible with security-reviewed pipelines

See [`docs/aws.md`](docs/aws.md) for:

* OIDC provider setup
* IAM role trust policies
* Permission troubleshooting

### Azure

CleanCloud requires Azure service principal credentials:

```bash
export AZURE_CLIENT_ID=...
export AZURE_TENANT_ID=...
export AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=...  # Optional

cleancloud scan --provider azure
```

**Required Azure permissions:** Reader role on subscription.

See [`docs/azure.md`](docs/azure.md) for detailed setup and RBAC configuration.

### Tag-Based Filtering (Ignore Only)

CleanCloud supports tag-based filtering to reduce noise by ignoring findings for resources you explicitly mark.

This is useful when certain environments, teams, or services should be out of scope for hygiene review (for example: production or shared platform resources).

>⚠️ Tag filtering is **ignore-only**
> 
> It does **not** disable rules, modify resources, or protect them from deletion.
CleanCloud remains **read-only and review-only**.

### Configuration File (cleancloud.yaml)

Create a cleancloud.yaml file in your project root:

```
version: 1

tag_filtering:
  enabled: true
  ignore:
    - key: env
      value: production
    - key: team
      value: platform
    - key: keep   # key-only match (any value)

```

**Behavior:**
* If a resource has any matching tag, its finding is ignored
* Matching is exact (no regex, no partial matches)
* Multiple ignore rules are OR’ed (any match ignores)


### Command Line Overrides (Highest Priority)
You can pass ignore tags directly via CLI:
```
cleancloud scan \
  --provider aws \
  --ignore-tag env:production \
  --ignore-tag team:platform

```

**Important:**
* CLI --ignore-tag replaces YAML configuration
* YAML and CLI tags are not merged
* This ensures CI/CD runs are explicit and predictable


#### Scan Output & Transparency

Ignored findings are:

❌ Not included in scan results

✅ Counted and reported in the summary

✅ Preserved internally for auditability

Example summary output:
```aiignore
Ignored by tag policy: 7 findings
```

#### Recommended Usage

Tag filtering works best with **broad ownership or scope tags**, such as:

* env: production
* team: platform
* service: core-infra

It is **not intended** for per-resource exceptions or lifecycle management.

## Design Philosophy

CleanCloud is built on three core principles:

### 1. Conservative by Default
- Age-based confidence thresholds (e.g., disks > 14 days = HIGH confidence)
- Multiple signals required before flagging resources
- Explicit confidence levels: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH

### 2. Read-Only Always
- No `Delete*` permissions required
- No `Tag*` permissions required
- No modification APIs called
- Safe for production accounts

### 3. Review-Only Recommendations
- Findings are candidates for human review, not automated action
- Clear reasoning provided for each finding
- Detailed metadata included for investigation

This makes CleanCloud safe for:
- ✅ Regulated environments
- ✅ Production accounts
- ✅ Security-reviewed pipelines
- ✅ Shared infrastructure

---

## Roadmap

### Coming Soon
- GCP support
- Additional AWS rules (unused Elastic IPs, old AMIs, empty security groups)
- Additional Azure rules (unused NICs, old images)
- Rule filtering (`--rules` flag)
- Configuration file support (`cleancloud.yaml`)

### Not Planned
- Automated cleanup or deletion
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Rightsizing suggestions
- Billing data access

CleanCloud will remain focused on **safe hygiene detection**, not automation or cost management.

CleanCloud never requires you to commit cloud credentials.
All scans run using standard AWS/Azure SDK credential resolution
(AWS profiles, env vars, or workload identity).

⚠️ Never commit secrets into this repository.

## Why "CleanCloud"?

Because clean code matters, clean infrastructure matters, and cleaning up cloud resources should be **safe, deliberate, and human-reviewed**—not automated and risky.
